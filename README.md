#24
A leisurely written program that is meant to compute the solutions to the game 24.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game

##Usage
Since 1, 4 and 24 are but just numbers, the author had simply rid the program of such petty mortal limits.
The program takes in any number of numbers and numerates numerous answers for any number.

However, as floating points are weak and clumsy creatures, all solutions with floating point/decimal intermediates were purged.

1. Either compile and run 24.cpp or run 24.exe if possible.
2. Enter numbers.
3. Enter answer.
4. Wait for a few eternities.
5. Long list of solution prints.

##Algorithm
Despite meditating upon the problem for many years on a mountain, the author has only managed to implement a brute force solution to the problem. Finding the complexity of this said solution is beyond the mathematical capability of _both_ the author and [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/). The last estimate made on the run time has it at &#8721;<sub>(k:1&rarr;n) </sub>6<sup>k</sup>(n!/k!)<sup>2</sup>(n-k+1) where n is the number of numbers fed in, and will produce a numnber larger than the height of the aforementioned holy mountain in millimeters should n be around 10.

Defeated by these trivial problems, the author saw 11<sub>2</sub> paths ahead. Between meditating upon the problem more, studying the mysterious forces of mathematics and worshipping the Bell-Curve god, the author has chosen the last option as his life goal.

To individuals who were foolish enough the confront the wrath of the exponentiation beast, the author presents to you the following magic charm, and wishes you luck on your journey.
